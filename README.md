### Go Banking

A basic REST API backend built in Go to handle core banking functionalities, including:

-   Creating and managing customers
-   Setting up authentication and authorization
-   Account creation and management
-   Handling fund transfers

This project is intentionally built without using external libraries/frameworks to keep things simple and strengthen my foundational understanding of Go and RESTful API development.
